    """Gets credentials implicitly from the current environment.

    .. note::
      You should not need to use this function directly. Instead, use the
      helper method :func:`gcloud.datastore.__init__.get_connection`
      which uses this method under the hood.

    Checks environment in order of precedence:

    * Google App Engine (production and testing)
    * Environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS pointing to
      a file with stored credentials information.
    * Stored "well known" file associated with ``gcloud`` command line tool.
    * Google Compute Engine production environment.

    The file referred to in GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is expected to
    contain information about credentials that are ready to use. This means
    either service account information or user account information with
    a ready-to-use refresh token::

      {                                       {
          'type': 'authorized_user',              'type': 'service_account',
          'client_id': '...',                     'client_id': '...',
          'client_secret': '...',       OR        'client_email': '...',
          'refresh_token': '...,                  'private_key_id': '...',

                                              }

    The second of these is simply a JSON key downloaded from the Google APIs
    console. The first is a close cousin of the "client secrets" JSON file
    used by ``oauth2client.clientsecrets`` but differs in formatting.
